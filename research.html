		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 12px;">  
				 Can a country reduce its exposure to tax havens, and what are the implications? Ecuador introduced a business income tax surcharge for firms with terminal owners from tax havens, 
				 a reform made possible by the establishment of a business ownership registry. We compare the behavior of firms with tax haven owners at baseline, versus other foreign-owned firms: 
				the reform induced 12 percent of haven-owned firms to report terminal owners outside havens, and the new owners are persons rather than firms, thus raising beneficial ownership transparency. 
				Moreover, exposed firms increase tax payments in Ecuador by 17%, without any impact on employment and limited effects on investment. We find that the policy combining a “flashlight” (the ownership registry) 
				and a “stick” (the tax surcharge) raised transparency and reduced tax erosion at limited efficiency cost.

			We examine the role of paid tax preparers in tax optimization of individual tax- payers. First, using the universe of annual personal income 
			tax returns in the US from 2011-2020, we provide novel descriptive evidence characterizing the paid tax preparers and the users of their services. 
			Second, we develop new measures of tax optimization and quantify the effects of paid preparers on tax optimization, leveraging the rotation of clients 
			among preparers. Our findings suggest that one standard deviation better tax preparers reduce the effective tax rates of their clients by 0.5 percentage 
			points, on average, with better tax preparers offering larger reductions and charging higher fees. The size of tax savings in levels and as a share of gross 
			income also increases in income taxpayer rank. We further find that tax preparers who are better at lowering their clients’ tax obligation are also suspected 
			more frequently of under-reporting by the tax authorities. Our results highlight the significant role that paid tax preparers play in shaping post-tax income disparities.

			I study the impact of an Ecuadorian outflows tax on the 
			reported income and personal income tax payments of individuals connected to tax havens. I identify Ecuadorian tax haven 
			users from the Panama Papers and connect them to administrative data on annual earnings, cross-border transactions, and on 
			beneficial ownership of businesses. I produce new descriptive evidence on tax haven users, finding that haven usage is 
			highly serially correlated within individuals over time. The 5% outflows tax induced exposed individuals to increase their 
			taxable income by 40% (20,000 USD) compared to unexposed high-earning taxpayers and pay 60% more in personal income taxes (PIT). 
			This response was concentrated within the highest earners in the Ecuadorian population and resulted in an aggregate increase in annual PIT 
			collections by around 4%. I characterize mechanisms and find that the increase in taxable income was driven by increases in 
			independent labor and capital income as well as wage income flows. Corroborating this response, I document 1) an increase in 
			labor payouts of the companies owned by exposed individuals, 2) a decrease in their outflows to tax havens, and 3) an increase in 
			their inflows from tax havens. These results are consistent with a lasting reduction in offshore tax evasion and suggest that countries 
			can indeed act unilaterally to mitigate tax haven use and increase tax collections.

		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 12px;">  
			We evaluate the existence of the pink tax: the hypothesized price premium on women's consumer goods. 
			Using retail and grocery scanner data, we find that women pay 5.1% more for consumer packaged goods in the same product-by-location market. 
			This price differential is generated by women paying 21.2% higher average prices for explicitly gendered products, like personal care items, 
			and 4.8% higher average prices for ungendered products, like food items. We study the mechanisms driving these differences by 
			estimating gender differences in price elasticities, market structures, wholesale prices charged to retailers, and marginal costs of 
			production. When we directly observe wholesale prices for a subset of goods, we find that women's goods feature lower markups than do those of men. 
			We estimate product quality using a constant elasticity of substitution model of demand; we find that women are consistently more price elastic than are 
			men and that women's consumer goods are valuated at 25% higher quality than ungendered goods within the same market. Finally, we estimate marginal 
			costs using a differentiated products demand model within the disposable razors market and arrive at similar conclusions: within producer, 
			women's razors see higher marginal costs and lower markups. The pink tax is not sustained by higher markups, but by women sorting 
			into goods with higher marginal costs. This finding implies that legislation aimed at eliminating gender differential pricing will not substantially 
			ameliorate gender-differential costs of living and may drive product exit.

			We leverage variation in the timing of unconditional housing recipiency by homeless individuals in 
			Los Angeles County to determine the effects of housing on their employment, earnings, and benefits absorption. We 
			validate our event study approach by demonstrating a parallel trends assumption and that wait times are unrelated to 
			homelessness severity. We find that placement into 2-year Rapid Re-Housing increases extensive-margin employment by 55% from a 20pp baseline. 
			Individuals that made unemployment-to-employment and employment-to-employment transitions exhibited earnings increases of USD 1000 and USD 250 per month, respectively,
			while exhibiting no change in benefits absorption. Permanent Supportive Housing recipients exhibited no substantial change in labor market outcomes around 
			their placement into housing, but we do observe a decrease in their reported labor-search behavior. We argue that these differences between programmatic 
			outcomes speak to differences in targeting rather than treatment. We perform a simple cost-benefit calculation based on impacts on labor market outcomes 
			and pecuniary benefits, and find that because most recipients are still unemployed or in a low-earning job post-event, the cost-offset through increased 
			earnings alone is near-zero.

			I study how charitable contributions reported by nonprofit entities respond to variation in the

			since 2002— distinguishing between private charities and public charities and between family foundations and non-familial private foundations. 
			I find that private foundations respond between 2.5 and 5 times as strongly as public charities in response to variation in the top estate tax 
			rate, exhibiting reported contributions elasticities of around 2.5 for changes in the federal estate tax and around .5 for same-state-level reforms. 
			I also document a significant positive (negative) relationship between private foundation entry (exit) and estate tax rates. I document no significant 
			difference in response between familial and non-familial foundations. Finally, I show that private foundations feature greater opacity in terms 
			of their charitability objectives, demonstrate higher propensity to engage in self-benefiting transactions, and allocate greater shares of their 
			expenses to administrative activities. This work demonstrates that the well-documented positive relationship between charitable bequests and estate 
			taxation is largely driven by private foundations whose activity is associated with greater measures of private benefit.

			We study panhandling in Downtown Manhattan. Surprisingly few people panhandle 
			there at any given moment: about 8–10 people on average at a busy time, in a small area with an economy the size of Latvia's. 
			The redevelopment of Ground Zero and the resulting surge in economic activity—including the opening of North America's tallest 
			building—changed where panhandlers operated within the neighborhood, but did not significantly increase panhandling overall. 
			The response was muted because the labor supply of panhandlers appears to be inelastic. On the other hand, good places to 
			panhandle are relatively abundant. Hence the benefits of the boom in economic activity accrued mainly to incumbent 
			panhandlers themselves; as would the benefits of greater donor generosity.

			What does wise public policy toward panhandling look like? When
			a willing, reasonably well informed donor gives money to a panhandler, both
			are better off, and inequality goes down. Policy should encourage transactions

			person is worse off. Policy should discourage this kind of interaction. We
			examine an array of programs to deal with panhandling to see how well they

			ones. Tentatively, credentialing programs are the most promising.

			We study the administration of income tax noncompliance penalties in Norway. 
			Penalties potentially offer a low-cost tool for tax administrations to use in reducing tax 
			noncompliance and decreasing the tax gap. We exploit a legislative reform that decreased the 
			statutory income tax noncompliance penalty rate from 30% to 20% of underreported base to evaluate 
			the impact of the penalty rate on the ex-post behavior of penalized taxpayers. We find that taxpayers 
			penalized under the lower rate regime declare 10% less income and pay 10% less in taxes in the years 
			following their penalties than do those under the prior higher-rate regime. This response is not explained 
			by differences in pre-event income or social demographic characteristics. We also find that following the 
			decrease in the penalty rate, administrative appeals also drop by 3%, suggesting that greater penalties exert 
			an administrative cost. We contextualize our findings within two models that conceptually 
			illustrate the tradeoffs of penalties, demonstrating theoretically that higher penalties may 
			induce increased litigation/appeals, which may be costly from the tax administration's perspective. 
			We conclude with a model of optimal penalty rates, finding that to a first-order approximation, 
			the statutory penalty rate should be set so that the actuarial penalty rate---the in-expectation net payment 
			rate per unit of underreported income---equals the optimal linear income tax rate.

			We develop a methodology for quantifying agents' behavioral responses to "one-time fiscal events" (OTFEs)---policies that occur only once with no de 
			jure periodicity. OTFEs occur around the world with considerable frequency, e.g. capital levies, corporate windfall taxes, tax amnesties, debt forgiveness, etc. 
			These policies are typically justified based on an argument that they change no incentives at the margin and therefore induce no behavioral distortions (beyond 
			income effects). However, this argument does not hold if agents perceive changes in their fiscal environments in expectation (e.g., a non-zero probability of a 
			repeated OTFE). We develop a microeconometric framework and methodology for estimating agents' responses to OTFEs. The central innovation of this methodology 
			involves soliciting agent's subjective beliefs around the implementation of a one-time policy and relating these beliefs to outcomes and key behavioral 
			parameters of interest (e.g. elasticities). We implement our methodology in an online experiment and in a field experiment in the Democratic Republic of the 
			Congo to estimate the impacts of one-time retrospective wage taxes on agents’ beliefs over fiscal policy and on their present labor supply, 
			which will allow us to estimate labor supply elasticities with respect to the net-of-tax wage. This methodology offers a new tool for policymakers in 
			evaluating the optimality of one-time policies as well as for applied researchers to study a previously unexplored policy domain and estimate key 
			elasticities of interest.
